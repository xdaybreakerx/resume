# Astro based Resume

Previously I hosted a resume equivalent on Read.cv, which has [since announced they are winding down](https://read.cv/a-new-chapter) their product as they are joining the team at Perplexity.

As such, I've recreated the functionality I want with Astro.

This will be used as an extension of my portfolio site, which you can [find here.](https://xandersalathe.com)

This project is based on the [Astro Resume Theme by srleom.](https://astro.build/themes/details/resume/)
